Advanced Installation Instructions for the Xgrep Utility

This distribution includes standard installer packages for the macOS platform
and Linux platforms (CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).
If you are installing on one of these platforms, have superuser (root)
privileges, do not want to install the xgrep utility in your HOME directory, and
do not want to customize the installation process, please refer to file
Install.txt for instructions on using the standard installers.

Make files for macOS and Linux platforms are included in this distribution.
Compilation on other Unix platforms should be possible as well, however it has
not been tested, so there may be errors.  If this occurs, please contact the
author with the details so that the problem can be resolved.  (See the ReadMe.md
file for contact information.)  Note that if you are installing on a macOS
system, Xcode must already be installed (vers. 7.2.1 or later recommended) so
that command-line tools are available.

To build and install the xgrep utility, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this CustomInstall.txt file:

	$ cd xgrep-master

 2. Remove any existing package binaries:

	$ make clean

 3. Build the xgrep utility.  This will create file "xgrep" in the current
    directory.  Note that during compilation you may see warnings about
    uninitialized variables, signed/unsigned comparisons, or other messages with
    some compilers.  These may be ignored:

	$ make

 4. Install xgrep.  If you have superuser privileges and want to do a site-wide
    install, go to the next step; otherwise, go to step 7.

 5. Perform a site-wide install:

	$ su root
	# make install
	# exit

 6. Go to step 9.

 7. Perform a local (user) install.  Supply the pathname of the local
    installation directory with the INSTALL variable; for example,
    "$HOME/xgrep":

	$ make install INSTALL=$HOME/xgrep

 8. Modify your shell startup file in your HOME directory so that the shell can
    find the xgrep binary.  For example, add the following line to file
    ~/.profile if you are using the Bourne shell (bash) or to file ~/.zshenv if
    you are using zsh:

	export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/xgrep/bin"

 9. Installation completed.

See xgrep(1) for a description of the xgrep utility and its switches, and
xre_format(7) for a description of the regular expression syntax.
