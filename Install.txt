Instructions for Installing the Xgrep Utility

Installer packages for the xgrep utility are included for the macOS platform and
Linux platforms (CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).  The
standard installation packages place files in /usr/local and require superuser
(root) privileges.  (Man pages and the 'xgrep' binary are installed.)  If you
are not installing on a macOS or GNU/Linux platform, want to install in your
HOME directory, or want to customize the installation process, please refer to
file CustomInstall.txt for instructions.

For a standard installation of xgrep, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this Install.txt file:

	$ cd xgrep-master

 2. If you are installing on a Linux platform, go to the next step; otherwise,
    go to step 5.

 3. The Linux installer is xgrep-1.0.0.sh, which includes a 64-bit binary built
    on a CentOS vers. 6 machine.  To run the installer, type the following
    commands:

	$ su root
	# ./xgrep-1.0.0.sh
	# exit

 4. Go to step 6.

 5. The macOS installer is xgrep-1.0.0.pkg, which includes a 64-bit binary built
    for macOS vers. 10.12 (Sierra) and later.  Open the installer package with
    the following command:

	$ open xgrep-1.0.0.pkg

    and run the installer.  You will be prompted to enter your password so that
    administrator privileges can be enabled.

 6. The installers place the xgrep binary in /usr/local/bin.  Be sure to include
    this directory in your shell PATH.

See xgrep(1) for a description of the xgrep utility and its switches, and
xre_format(7) for a description of the regular expression syntax.
